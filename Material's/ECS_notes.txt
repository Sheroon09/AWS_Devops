NOTES ON ECS:
=============
what is ECS?
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.
ECS is a managed container orchestrator
IT COMES UNDER SAME FAMILY OF DOCKER,SWARM AND KUBERNETTES AND IS MAINTAINED BY AWS
ECS IS "BRAINS BEHIND" HOW YOU Deploy "YOUR Containers"
ECS only works with containers
why ORCHESTRATORS?
manage life cycles of containers create/restart/destroy
Deploy and load balance application across multiple servers
autoscaling to handle variance in traffic
Rolling out changes to application
what is cluster?
cluster is a bunch of resources that your containers run on. bunch of EC2 VM's.
ECS vs OTHERS
Docker Compose Deployment
user composes a doceker-compose.yml and suppose we have 3 servers we can deploy the docker file in 3 servers but the three servers don't know about all three having same docker file to run
docker composer do not have autoscaling but in orchestration we have that
ECS is a simple alternative for traditional orchestrators
===================================================================
ECS infrastructure and launch:
ECS has two launch types
EC2
FARGATE
 EC2 LAUNCH TYPE:
 ================
 in ec2-we have to manage the underlying ec2 instances
 ECS control pane
 cluster- ec2-ec2-we have to install dockers and ECS agent
 YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE.
 EC2 vs FARGATE(serverless)
 ==============
 FARGATE- aws manages underlying infrastructure
 ECS control pane - fargate - NO EC2 instances.
 fargate will create servers "on-demand".
 once the ec2 instances are created our cluster will deploy the container services.
 You do not need to maintain or provision any ec2 instances.
 you are paying for what you use and if any of the servers scales down it decrease your cost as well.
 ECS TASK DEFNITION:
 ===================
 Task definition file is going to act as a blueprint that describes how containers should launch.
 how much CPU/MEM
 image/ports/volumes
 what is a task?
 An instance of a task definition.
 a running container with settings defined in the task definition.
 ECS Services:
 -============
 what is a service?
 a service ensures that a certain number of tasks are running at all times, It also restarts containers that have exited/crashed so we have two instances.
 SERVICE is also monitors EC2 instance fails, the service will restart task on a working ec2 instance.
 LOAD BALANCERS:
 ================
 a load balancer is just to make sure routed to all our resources and make sures the load is balanced across all instances.
